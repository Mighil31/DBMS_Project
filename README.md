## DBMS_Project - Order Management System

### Abstract
Our Order Management System is for a company that sells construction materials to customers who buy different products. Each customer can have more than one address and is assigned to a default salesperson who is a liaison between the customer and the company. The company sells multiple products. When a customer orders more than one product at a time, all order items are logically grouped in an order line. 

The OMS is implemented as an easy to use website where client-side scripting is facilitated through HTML, CSS, JavaScript with the data being stored and processed in the server-side script using Node.js.

### Business Rules
(1) One shipment contains one order.

(2) To have three different users â€“ Salesperson, Sales department clerks, and Warehouse supervisors.

(3) In the website, each user has access only to his/her functionality.

### Need and Motivation
Our Order Management System (OMS) can help a company selling construction materials to customers. It can perform multiple activities like tracking the stock of each product, viewing the list of customers and the products bought and so on. This will reduce costs and save time for the company and at the same time will facilitate easy retrieval and modification of data.
